# Phase 1 Code Challenge
## Goals for the challenge
    1. To test and see if i can apply the skills learnt so far
    2. to further practice on the content learnt through phase 1 and phase 0

## Questions to tackle 
    Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
    Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

    A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

 

    Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
    Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

    For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

 

    Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
    Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

## Approaches used 
    Mainly used functions to create a working programforthe threee challenges which can be recalled when one need to execute a computation depending on what the computation is .
    There are three functions: 
        1.function gradeSystem
        2.function speedCheck
        3.function calcSalary (values used here are from ):
